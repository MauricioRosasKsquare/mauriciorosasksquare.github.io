    <h3>Biography</h2>
    <h4><b>2013 Season</b></h4>
    <p>Bjergsen began his professional League of Legends career at a very young age. During the Season 3 European LCS, he was unable to play with his team Copenhagen Wolves until the third week of the spring split due to age restrictions put in place by Riot Games. For the first two weeks, he was temporarily replaced by the team's substitute, cowTard. After he turned 17 years old on February 21, he was able to rejoin the main lineup and play their remaining LCS matches. At the end of the Spring split, he and the rest of the Copenhagen Wolves starting lineup moved to the organization Ninjas in Pyjamas, where he played in the Summer split.</p>
    <h4>2014 Season</h4>
    <p>On November 2, 2013, Bjergsen left NiP to move to NA and join the Team SoloMid starting lineup as their mid laner, replacing Reginald and becoming the second player to move from the European LCS to play in the North American LCS after Edward left Gambit to join Curse during Season 3. Bjergsen debuted at the Battle of the Atlantic, where TSM played against Lemondogs. They won their series 2-0, and North America beat Europe in combined score. <br> On January 23, 2014, Bjergsen received a competitive ruling for having violated the LCS rules by approaching and encouraging a contracted LCS player to leave his position at Lemondogs. He admitted to having committed the violation and was fined $2,000.</p>
